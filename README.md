Webtronix is broken due to browser compatibility issues
---
GOAL
------

The schematic is the language of electronics. Webtronix exists to simplify posting of schematics and improve discussion of electronic circuits.The output is SVG so it will open in most browsers. It uses Emscripten compiled Gnucap to do simulation.

Webtronix is not meant to replace professional tools, it is meant to complement them. I feel that free tools are a necessity and open source and standardization have a great advantage.

1.To create schematics that can easily be shared for discussion and improvements.

2.To create Schematics that can simulate and verify circuits.

3.To use the web in ways that benefit the users.

I have big ideas for web based engineering tools and I would love to be part of a related project.

Mostly I am using webtronix myself because I only run linux and there are not a lot of choicese for simulating circuits.
